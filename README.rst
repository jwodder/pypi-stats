``pypi-stats`` (note hyphen) is a wrapper around pypistats_ (note non-hyphen)
for making API requests to <https://pypistats.org> (note .org).  Specifically,
it takes the names of a number of PyPI packages (and/or PyPI users via the
``-u``/``--user`` option) and lists the packages' and users' packages'
downloads stats for the last month, week, and day.  By default, it outputs in
CSV, but the ``-T``/``--table`` option can be used to get an ASCII table.

That's it.  That's all it does.
